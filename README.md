Game Engine Design and Development - Project 2

I will add the DX11 project when I get to the lab.

I have a few of the requirements for this project templated out already from Game Graphics Programming. I think it consists of
drawing and rendering (basic homework stuffs). May use what I have but leave most of it out based on how we want to go about 
creating it ourselves because I am assuming it will be different.
